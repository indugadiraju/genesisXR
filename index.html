        <h2>Inspiration</h2>

        <ul class = "feature-list">
        <li>
            Our project grew from a simple realization: so many of the things we <i> think </i> we learned from school,
            we actually learned from the games we grew up with — Minecraft, Little Alchemy, PBS Kids.
            Those games made curiosity feel natural. They made real-world processes feel intuitive.
        </li>
        <li>
            But access to hands-on learning isn’t equal. As public schools face overcrowding and shrinking resources,
            immersive, experimental learning becomes harder to access — and that’s a real equity issue.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, as Stanford students, we see a different gap: classes often start at a high level,
            skipping the fundamentals. Students are left wondering, 
            <em>“Okay… but how does this actually work?”</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            That’s why we built Genesis MR — to bring back discovery and make foundational learning accessible,
            immersive, and equitable.

    <!-- WHAT IT DOES -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>What It Does</h2>
        <p>
            Genesis MR is a mixed-reality platform where learners experiment with the building blocks of the world.
            Users pick up virtual objects, combine them, and watch real scientific processes unfold.
        </p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Sand + Heat → Glass</strong>: see the chemistry and physics behind the transformation.</li>
            <li><strong>Fire + Wood → Charcoal</strong>: learn the mechanisms of pyrolysis in real time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Every interaction is simple, intuitive, and grounded in real science. 
        </p>

        <p> </p>
            
        <p> 
            Because everything happens in MR, Genesis MR removes the need for labs, equipment,
            or specialized classrooms — leveling the playing field for all learners.
